# Neural-Networks-for-Classification
Keywords: Dense Neural network, Keras, Supervised Learning, Classification

This notebook was prepared for the seventh project of the Post Graduate Program in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning: Business Applications from the McCombs School of Business at The University of Texas. The data was provided in a .csv file and was a subset of a larger dataset from Kaggle.

This was a supervised learning, classification problem to predict which bank customers would “churn” i.e. leave the bank in the next 6 months. The focus of this project was neural networks. I built sequential- dense-neural-networks using tensor flow keras.

In this notebook I tried many, many different architectures of dense neural networks. However, nothing made much improvement. In this case I ran into a natural limit in the data. In this case the target class was so heterogeneously mixed into the data that the decision boundaries between the target and non-target class were very complex. As a result, they did not generalize well. While complex architectures could fit the training data, they did not fit the test data.

While this project was done as part of a school project. I believe it indicates the quality of work that I’m capable of in real-world applications. I was the top student in my cohort with a final course weighted average of 99.39%.
